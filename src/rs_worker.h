/*
 * Response worker thread
 *
 * This manages async requests to libunbound and the worker thread that passes
 * results back to the libuv event loop.
 *
 * libunbound requests go through two queues:
 * - When the request is made, it enters the "pending request" queue
 *   (hsk_rs_pending_t)
 * - When the response is received from libunbound, it moves to the "response"
 *   queue (hsk_rs_queue_t)
 * - When the callback is delivered in the libuv event loop, it is removed from
 *   the response queue
 *
 * The two queues are necessary to avoid busy-waiting in the worker thread, to
 * hand responses back to the libuve event loop, and to be able to cancel
 * outstanding requests and shut down the worker thread.  They also ensure we
 * don't leak any memory for in-flight requests that are canceled at shutdown.
