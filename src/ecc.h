Compute a shared secret given your secret key and someone else's public key.
Note: It is recommended that you hash the result of ecdh_shared_secret before using it for symmetric encryption or HMAC.

Inputs:

Outputs:

Returns 1 if the shared secret was generated successfully, 0 if an error occurred.

Generate an ECDSA signature for a given hash value.

Usage: Compute a hash of the data you wish to sign (SHA-2 is recommended) and pass it in to
this function along with your private key.

Inputs:

    p_hash       - The message hash to sign.

Outputs:

Returns 1 if the signature generated successfully, 0 if an error occurred.

Verify an ECDSA signature.

Usage: Compute the hash of the signed data using the same hash as the signer and
pass it to this function along with the signer's public key and the signature values (r and s).

Inputs:
    p_publicKey - The signer's public key
    p_hash      - The hash of the signed data.
    p_signature - The signature value.

Returns 1 if the signature is valid, 0 if it is invalid.
